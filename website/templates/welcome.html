      <p>Early Days' overarching aim is providing an application that will aid individuals as they navigate the early stages of getting to know a potential partner.</p> 
      <p>We do so through an engaging questionnaire that encapsulates a series of prompts to discover what dealbreakers may exist for a particular person to prevent them from entering a relationship.</p>
      <p>Once you have completed the questionnaire, you will be presented with a category that defines the trend of the responses you've provided.</p> 
      <p>This category will be intelligently determined through machine learning and accompanied by a detailed summary of characteristics and acknowledgments derived from your questionnaire answers.</p>
      <p>If you wish to, you may then progress and compare your answers with those of another user.</p>
      <p>A scoring algorithm will then perform some permutations to provide you with a compatibility score.</p>
      <p>You also have the option to look into your compatibility within a variety of categories if you want a more focused understanding of align or misaligned values.</p>

        <p id ="introduction">Early Days' mission is to guide users through an engaging process to indentify personal relationship dealbreakers and preferences.
        In an era of increasingly fast-paced dating dynamics, navigating the early stages of getting to know a potential partner has its complexities, particularly when it comes to assessing compatibility with those prospective partners. 
        Early Days aims to provide a solution to this issue so that everyone can feel empowered to determine their compatibility and acknowledge dealbreakers shamelessly.
